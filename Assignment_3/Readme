##MATLAB Modeling of Rankine and Brayton Power Cycles
#Overview

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of the Rankine and Brayton thermodynamic power cycles developed entirely from first principles. The models compute all thermodynamic state points, evaluate cycle performance, incorporate non-ideal effects, and perform parametric studies to provide engineering insight into real power systems.
No prebuilt cycle simulators or external property libraries are used. All calculations are implemented using fundamental thermodynamic relations and tabulated property data.

#Objectives

Compute all thermodynamic state points of Rankine and Brayton cycles
Evaluate turbine work, pump/compressor work, net work output, and thermal efficiency
Study the impact of non-ideal component efficiencies
Perform parametric studies to understand design trade-offs
Generate physically meaningful thermodynamic plots

#Rankine Cycle Model

Modeling Assumptions:-

Steady-state, steady-flow operation
Negligible kinetic and potential energy changes
Water/steam as the working fluid
Constant-pressure heat addition (boiler) and heat rejection (condenser)
Turbine inlet temperature specified as an input
Steam properties obtained from saturation tables with interpolation
Superheated steam modeled using constant specific heat relations
Both ideal (isentropic pump and turbine) and real cycles are modeled by incorporating pump and turbine isentropic efficiencies.

Key Results:-

Turbine work is significantly larger than pump work, resulting in a low back-work ratio, characteristic of steam power plants
Isentropic efficiencies reduce net work output and thermal efficiency due to irreversibilities
Thermal efficiency increases with boiler pressure due to a higher average temperature of heat addition
Efficiency improvement diminishes at high boiler pressures because of increased pump work and moisture content at turbine exit
These results explain practical limits on boiler pressure in real Rankine cycle power plants.

#Brayton Cycle Model

Modeling Assumptions:-

Simple open Brayton cycle
Air modeled as an ideal gas
Constant-pressure heat addition and rejection
Initial model assumes constant specific heats
Extended model includes compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies
Further extension incorporates temperature-dependent specific heat
Pressure ratio and turbine inlet temperature treated as primary inputs

Key Results:-

Thermal efficiency increases monotonically with pressure ratio in the ideal cycle
Net work output exhibits a maximum at an intermediate pressure ratio
Component inefficiencies significantly reduce net work and efficiency
Variable specific heat modeling predicts lower performance than constant-specific heat models, especially at high turbine inlet temperatures
A large fraction of turbine work is consumed by the compressor, highlighting a fundamental limitation of gas turbine systems

Effect of Altitude:-
Altitude is modeled as a reduction in inlet pressure. Lower inlet pressure decreases air density and mass flow rate, resulting in:
Significant reduction in net power output
Slight reduction in thermal efficiency
This behavior explains the performance degradation of gas turbines at high altitudes and motivates advanced compressor and inlet designs in aerospace applications.

#Conclusion

The MATLAB models accurately capture the thermodynamic behavior of Rankine and Brayton cycles under ideal and non-ideal conditions. The Rankine cycle demonstrates high efficiency with a low back-work ratio, making it suitable for large-scale power generation. The Brayton cycle shows strong sensitivity to pressure ratio, component efficiencies, and inlet conditions, which is critical for gas turbine and aerospace applications.
Parametric studies provide valuable insight into optimal operating ranges and real-world design constraints.
